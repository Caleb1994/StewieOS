StewieOS
========

StewieOS is a simple hobby kernel/operating system. This is my third rewrite to date. The kernel is based on UNIX/POSIX
standards although I cannot say I necessaraly follow those standards at all times. It is monolithic, higher-half kernel.
It's nothing special at the moment, but I am looking forward to a day when I can boot it up and do something useful with
it.

If you would like to see some screenshots or other random things I might upload aside from code, you can check out my
